# 📘 Proffy

This project was developed during the "next level week" of Rocketseat, instructed by Mayk Brito.

It is a platform where everyone can study and teach. To study, the student must access the page and search for his class in our bank of teachers. Teachers can also be part of our team just by providing us with some information. Come and be part of our team.
