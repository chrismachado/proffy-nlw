# 📘 Proffy

This project was developed during the "next level week" of Rocketseat, instructed by Mayk Brito.

It is a platform where everyone can study and teach. To study, the student must access the page and search for his class in our bank of teachers. Teachers can also be part of our team just by providing us with some information. Come and be part of our team.

# ✏️ How to

First of all you'll need to clone this repository by using

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/chrismachado/proffy-nlw.git
$ code proffy-nlw/
```

_Note¹: if you don't have git install, [check it out](https://git-scm.com/downloads)._

_Note²: I'm using code, but you can use any editor you want._

Then, 

```bash
## use npm
$ npm install 
$ npm run dev

## or, use yarn
$ yarn install
$ yarn run dev

```

After this, just type in your browser's url _https://localhost:5500_.
